Raffle Smart Contract Project
This project is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) built for an on-chain Raffle system. It includes smart contract development, automated testing, and deployment scripts, designed for deployment and testing on Ethereum testnets like Sepolia.

📦 Project Structure

Folder / File	Purpose
contracts/Raffle.sol	Main Raffle contract logic
script/DeployRaffle.s.sol	Deployment script for Raffle contract
script/HelperConfig.s.sol	Network configuration (e.g., Chainlink VRF settings)
script/Interactions.s.sol	Interaction script for adding consumer to VRF subscription
test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol	Unit tests for Raffle contract
⚙️ Technologies Used
Solidity

Foundry (Forge, Anvil)

Chainlink VRF v2

Sepolia Testnet

[Hardhat/Anvil](optional for local testing)

Alchemy or Infura for Sepolia RPC

🚀 Deployment
Deploy to Sepolia:

Set your environment variables:

bash
Copy
Edit
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY
Run the deployment script:

bash
Copy
Edit
forge script script/DeployRaffle.s.sol:DeployRaffle --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify -vvvv
--broadcast sends the transaction.

--verify verifies the contract on Etherscan.

-vvvv sets verbose logging level.

🧪 Testing
Run unit tests locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
forge test
Run tests against a forked Sepolia chain:

bash
Copy
Edit
forge test --fork-url https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY -vvvv
Forks the Sepolia chain locally using Anvil.

Allows interaction with real Chainlink VRF Coordinator and contracts.

⚡ Note: When running forked tests, impersonation may be required for VRF subscription management.

🛠️ Scripts Summary
DeployRaffle.s.sol: Deploys the Raffle contract and sets it up with Chainlink VRF.

HelperConfig.s.sol: Supplies network-specific constants (e.g., VRF Coordinator, Gas Lane, Subscription ID).

Interactions.s.sol: Adds the deployed Raffle contract as a consumer to Chainlink VRF subscription.

📜 Raffle Contract Features
Users can enter the Raffle by paying an entrance fee.

Chainlink VRF is used to randomly pick a winner.

Timed interval between draws.

Automatic funding with LINK tokens for randomness requests.

⚡ Chainlink Integration
VRF Coordinator Address: 0x9DdfaCa8183c41ad55329BdeeD9F6A8d53168B1B (Sepolia)

Gas Lane and Subscription ID provided via HelperConfig.s.sol.

🧹 Notes
Forked tests require impersonating subscription owners when interacting with Chainlink VRF.

Use vm.startPrank(ownerAddress) during forked testing to bypass ownership checks.

Always make sure your Sepolia subscription is funded if testing on-chain randomness.

✨ Happy Building!
Would you also like me to generate a simple badge section (like “build passing”, "license MIT", etc.) at the top of the README if you want it to look even more GitHub-pro-level? 🚀
I can add that if you want!
